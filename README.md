<h1>Classic Monitor ESP32 MQTT/Blynk publisher</h1>



<p>
Classic Monitor MQTT/Blynk will read data from your classic over Modbus and publish it to a MQTT broker. It is a Read Only Program, it does not write to the Classic.
You can also configure a Blynk app to display basic data from your classic.
The software is provided "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, express or implied.
Classic Monitor is NOT a product of Midnite solar, nor do they support this application!
